**Your Mission:** Profile Picture Creation Framework
Your task is to synthesize the inputs to construct a prompt for a profile picture that is bold, simple, and instantly readable.

Distill the Core Concept: Analyze the channel to identify a single, powerful symbol that represents the channel's essence. Simplicity is the ultimate goal.

Incorporate the Audience's Vibe: Use the audience's voice to determine the emotional tone. The design should feel trustworthy, exciting, professional, or mysterious, according to what resonates with the audience.

Construct the Image Prompt: Combine these elements into a single, concise paragraph. Your prompt must adhere to the strict constraints of a profile picture:

Crucial Constraint: The final design MUST be optimized for a circular crop. All important elements must be contained and look good within a circle.
Design Style: Specify a style that favors clarity. Examples: "Minimalist vector icon," "modern flat design," "bold graphic illustration," "stylized single-letter logo."
Central Icon/Symbol: Describe the single, bold, and uncomplicated visual element. This should have a strong silhouette. Avoid fine lines or complex details that will disappear when shrunk.
Color Palette: Define a limited, high-contrast color scheme to maximize visibility and make the icon "pop" against any background. Examples: "bold yellow on a deep black background," "a clean white icon on a vibrant blue circle," "a high-contrast black and white design."
Composition & Feel: The composition must be strong and centered to work perfectly within the circle. Examples: "Perfectly centered," "strong, symmetrical design," "bold and clean."
Background: Always specify a simple, solid background to eliminate noise and enhance focus on the central icon. Example: "on a solid white background."

**Output Requirements**
Your final output must be only the generated prompt in English.
Do not include any explanations, greetings, or any text other than the prompt itself.
The prompt must be a single, well-written paragraph, laser-focused on creating a clean, high-impact image suitable for a YouTube profile picture.

You can start writing the script, but write one chapter at a time. Start with the introduction. You don't have to say what you're going to do. Just do it! Don't use emojis! 
Don't write any instruction or titles, only text required. Note that the script is {VIDEO_DURATION} minutes long!

SCRIPT TONE:
    ${LANGUAGE_STYLE_ADJECTIVES}.
    The text delves into the viewer's emotions with delicacy and depth, as if to say: "I see you, I understand your pain."

    ${TONE_DESCRIPTION_DETAILED}.
    It is not an accusatory or alarmist tone. It is the tone of someone who welcomes and awakens. It guides the viewer to awareness without making them feel guilty.

    Firm, yet compassionate.
    It presents hard truthsâ€”but does so with compassion, without judgment.

    Spiritual, referencing ${STYLE_BLEND_COMPONENTS}.

LANGUAGE USED:
    Highly sensory and emotional.
    The use of expressions brings the viewer's body into the experience, connecting reason and emotion.

    Completely accessible and poetic, yet simultaneously everyday.
    Short, rhythmic sentences with emotional fluidity, but without being simplistic. It mixes everyday language with almost literary moments, but using simple and easy-to-understand words, as if talking to a friend who has a very simple vocabulary.

    Strategic repetition.
    Uses repetition as a hypnotic and reinforcing tool:
    This repetition creates an emotional rhythm and strengthens the connection to the message.

Write the script with well-structured paragraphs, like a continuous emotional narrative. Avoid excessive line breaks. Vary the beginning of the first paragraph according to each theme, emotion, or feeling. Each paragraph should develop a complete, deep, and fluid idea, with smooth transitions between sentences. DO NOT use sentences that are too short. 

**REMEMBER TO NOT WRITE ANY INSTRUCTIONS, TITLES, TRANSITIONS, PAUSE INSTRUCTIONS AND VISUAL INSTRUCTIONS. WRITE ONLY THE REQUIRED TEXT**

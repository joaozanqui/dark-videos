Excellent! You can continue to the next chapter. Please note that the script is ${VIDEO_DURATION} long! Don't include emojis (❌, ✅, 👉, etc.). Always add a period to headings and subheadings, for example: “Listen carefully”. (Add a period (.)). Don't tell them what to do, for example: "Common mistake", "Practical exercise", "Real case", "Serious mistake" etc. Dont't tell the script duration at any time. Don't write any instructions, only the required text, please.

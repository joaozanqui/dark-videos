VIDEO TITLE IN ${LANGUAGE_AND_REGION}: ${VIDEO_TITLE}

Create ${NUMBER_OF_INTRO_TOPICS} topic(s) for the introduction (develop only bullet points for what should be covered, and for each intro, cite or use analogies from ${STYLE_REFERENCE_PERSON_1} or ${STYLE_REFERENCE_PERSON_2}, choosing only one per introduction). Create ${NUMBER_OF_DEV_TOPICS} topics for the main body of the script. Create ${NUMBER_OF_CONCLUSION_TOPICS} topic(s) for the conclusion (develop only bullet points for what should be covered, and for each conclusion, cite or use analogies from ${STYLE_REFERENCE_PERSON_1} or ${STYLE_REFERENCE_PERSON_2}, choosing only one per conclusion).

OBJECTIVE: Create topics that reveal hidden truths, ${HIDDEN_ISSUES_EXAMPLES}, always with original narratives, real examples, ${PREFERRED_CONTENT_ELEMENT_1}, and ${PREFERRED_CONTENT_ELEMENT_2}. All of this should be in a ${LANGUAGE_STYLE_ADJECTIVES} language, based on the specific title of each video submitted.
Each set of topics must be unique, adapting to the ${CORE_AUDIENCE_PAIN_OR_GOAL} behind the title.
The topics should decode the emotional heart of the theme, revealing hidden truths and the mechanisms of ${NICHE_CORE_CONCEPTS}, with ${ANALYTICAL_LENSES} depth—according to the nature and proposal of the title.

FOR EACH THEME, YOU MUST:

    Deeply analyze the audience's hidden pain and desire behind the theme
        What silent ${EMOTIONAL_WOUND_TYPE} can this theme alleviate?
        What ${UNANSWERED_QUESTION_OR_DESIRE} is this person trying to solve with ${GUIDANCE_TYPE}?
        What kind of "${ENERGY_BLOCK_EXAMPLE_1}" or "${ENERGY_BLOCK_EXAMPLE_2}" can this theme decipher?

    Identify the mental, ${KNOWLEDGE_BASE_MAIN}-related, and neuro-emotional triggers involved
        ${TRIGGER_EXAMPLE_1_DESCRIPTION}
        ${TRIGGER_EXAMPLE_2_DESCRIPTION}
        ${TRIGGER_EXAMPLE_3_DESCRIPTION}

    Use emotional, symbolic, and applied language—without clichés or generic advice
        Absolutely avoid phrases like:
            ${CLICHE_PHRASE_EXAMPLE_1}
            ${CLICHE_PHRASE_EXAMPLE_2}
            ${CLICHE_PHRASE_EXAMPLE_3} (without concrete explanation)
        Prioritize:
            Powerful metaphors, scientific concepts, real stories, symbolic provocations, intelligent analogies, and non-obvious insights.

STYLE AND LANGUAGE:
Speak exclusively in ${LANGUAGE_AND_REGION}, with a ${LANGUAGE_STYLE_ADJECTIVES_2} language.
Your style unites:
${STYLE_INGREDIENT_1} + ${STYLE_INGREDIENT_2} + ${STYLE_INGREDIENT_3} + ${STYLE_INGREDIENT_4}
Didactic clarity, but without superficiality.
A tone that ${TONE_VERB_1}, ${TONE_VERB_2}, ${TONE_VERB_3}, and ${TONE_VERB_4}.
Completely avoid any ${AVOID_TONE_1}, ${AVOID_TONE_2}, or ${AVOID_TONE_3} tone.

TOPIC STRUCTURE (FOR DEVELOPMENT TOPICS):

    Theme Title: ${TOPIC_STRUCTURE_STEP1_DESCRIPTION}.
    Subtopic 1: ${TOPIC_STRUCTURE_STEP2_DESCRIPTION}.
    Subtopic 2: ${TOPIC_STRUCTURE_STEP3_DESCRIPTION}.
    Subtopic 3: ${TOPIC_STRUCTURE_STEP4_DESCRIPTION}.
    Subtopic 4: ${TOPIC_STRUCTURE_STEP5_DESCRIPTION}.
    Subtopic 5: ${TOPIC_STRUCTURE_STEP6_DESCRIPTION}.

SUBTOPICS (3–5)
(This section contains example structures. Adapt or provide new relevant examples for the niche when using the template).
Use structures like:

    “Beware of…”
    “The invisible error of…”
    “A practical exercise to…”
    “Myths about…”
    “Why most people fail when trying to…”
    “The silent factor that sabotages your ${NICHE_KEY_METRIC}”
    “A 3-step technique to reconnect your ${NICHE_KEY_METRIC}”

STYLE REFERENCES:

    ${STYLE_REFERENCE_PERSON_1}
    ${STYLE_REFERENCE_PERSON_2}

NEVER DO:

    Create topics with empty phrases like:
        ${EMPTY_PHRASE_EXAMPLE_1}
        ${EMPTY_PHRASE_EXAMPLE_2}
    Use ready-made motivational phrases, unfounded ${GUIDANCE_TYPE} advice, or predictable lists.
    Repeat formulas used in previous scripts.
    Offer generic advice without explaining the ${KNOWLEDGE_BASE_MAIN}, neuroscientific, or emotional "why."

TARGET AUDIENCE:
${TARGET_AUDIENCE_DEMOGRAPHICS_AND_PSYCHOGRAPHICS}, in search of ${AUDIENCE_DESIRES}.
They don't want magical promises, but rather ${TARGET_AUDIENCE_WANTS}.

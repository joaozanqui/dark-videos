**VIDEO TITLE IN ${LANGUAGE_AND_REGION}:** ${VIDEO_TITLE}
**VIDEO RATIONALE:** ${RATIONALE}

Create 1 topic for the introduction (develop only bullet points for what should be covered, and for each intro, cite or use analogies from ${STYLE_REFERENCE_PERSON_1} or ${STYLE_REFERENCE_PERSON_2}, choosing only one per introduction). Create ${NUMBER_OF_DEV_TOPICS} topics for the main body of the script. Create 1 topic for the conclusion (develop only bullet points for what should be covered, and for each conclusion, cite or use analogies from ${STYLE_REFERENCE_PERSON_1} or ${STYLE_REFERENCE_PERSON_2}, choosing only one per conclusion).

**OBJECTIVE:** Create topics that reveal hidden truths, ${HIDDEN_ISSUES_EXAMPLES}, always with original narratives, real examples, ${PREFERRED_CONTENT_ELEMENT_1}, and ${PREFERRED_CONTENT_ELEMENT_2}. All of this should be in a ${LANGUAGE_STYLE_ADJECTIVES} language, based on the specific title of each video submitted.
Each set of topics must be unique, adapting to the ${CORE_AUDIENCE_PAIN_OR_GOAL} behind the title.
The topics should decode the emotional heart of the theme, revealing hidden truths and the mechanisms of ${NICHE_CORE_CONCEPTS}, with ${ANALYTICAL_LENSES} depth—according to the nature and proposal of the title.

**FOR EACH THEME, YOU MUST:**
Deeply analyze the audience's hidden pain and desire behind the theme:
-What silent ${EMOTIONAL_WOUND_TYPE} can this theme alleviate?
-What ${UNANSWERED_QUESTION_OR_DESIRE} is this person trying to solve with ${GUIDANCE_TYPE}?
-What kind of "${ENERGY_BLOCK_EXAMPLE_1}" or "${ENERGY_BLOCK_EXAMPLE_2}" can this theme decipher?

Identify the mental, ${KNOWLEDGE_BASE_MAIN}-related, and neuro-emotional triggers involved:
-${TRIGGER_EXAMPLE_1_DESCRIPTION}
-${TRIGGER_EXAMPLE_2_DESCRIPTION}
-${TRIGGER_EXAMPLE_3_DESCRIPTION}

Use emotional, symbolic, and applied language—without clichés or generic advice without concrete explanation
-Absolutely avoid phrases like:
-${CLICHE_PHRASE_EXAMPLE_1}
-${CLICHE_PHRASE_EXAMPLE_2}
-${CLICHE_PHRASE_EXAMPLE_3} 

Prioritize: 
-Powerful metaphors, scientific concepts, real stories, symbolic provocations, intelligent analogies, and non-obvious insights.

**STYLE AND LANGUAGE:**
Speak exclusively in ${LANGUAGE_AND_REGION}, with a ${LANGUAGE_STYLE_ADJECTIVES_2} style.
Your style unites:
${STYLE_INGREDIENT_1} + ${STYLE_INGREDIENT_2} + ${STYLE_INGREDIENT_3} + ${STYLE_INGREDIENT_4}
Didactic clarity, but without superficiality.
A tone that ${TONE_VERB_1}, ${TONE_VERB_2}, ${TONE_VERB_3}, and ${TONE_VERB_4}.
Completely avoid any ${AVOID_TONE_1}, ${AVOID_TONE_2}, or ${AVOID_TONE_3} tone.

**TOPIC STRUCTURE (FOR DEVELOPMENT TOPICS):**
-Theme Title: ${TOPIC_STRUCTURE_STEP1_DESCRIPTION}.
-Subtopic 1: ${TOPIC_STRUCTURE_STEP2_DESCRIPTION}.
-Subtopic 2: ${TOPIC_STRUCTURE_STEP3_DESCRIPTION}.
-Subtopic 3: ${TOPIC_STRUCTURE_STEP4_DESCRIPTION}.
-Subtopic 4: ${TOPIC_STRUCTURE_STEP5_DESCRIPTION}.
-Subtopic 5: ${TOPIC_STRUCTURE_STEP6_DESCRIPTION}.

**SUBTOPICS (${NUMBER_OF_SUBTOPICS_MIN}–${NUMBER_OF_SUBTOPICS_MAX}):**
(This section contains example structures. Adapt or provide new relevant examples for the niche when using the template).
Use structures like:
“Beware of...”
“${EMOTIONAL_OR_COGNITIVE_ERROR_TYPE} error that looks like ${POSITIVE_TRAIT}, but hides ${NEGATIVE_BEHAVIOR}”
“Symbolic exercise to ${ACTION_VERB} with truth”
“Myths about ${COMMON_MISUNDERSTANDING_IN_NICHE}”
“The ${FACTOR_TYPE} factor that sabotages your ${DESIRED_SKILL_OR_CONNECTION}”
“A three-step ${KNOWLEDGE_BASE_MAIN} technique to discern ${GOAL_TO_DISCERN}”
“Why ${NEUROCHEMICAL_OR_STRESS_FACTOR} might hinder your ${DESIRED_STATE_OR_ACTION}”
“What the story of ${HISTORICAL_OR_ARCHETYPAL_FIGURE} reveals about ${RELEVANT_LESSON}”
“Mental healing model based on ${SOURCE_TEXT_OR_MODEL_EXAMPLE}”
“The impact of ${NEUROCHEMICAL_EXAMPLE} on ${SITUATION_EXAMPLE}”
“Real story: when the ${PERSON_TYPE} understood the reason for the ‘no’”
“Emotional consequence of ${ACTION_VERB} with a wounded ${WOUNDED_ASPECT}”
“How society has distorted the image of ${IDEALIZED_FIGURE_IN_NICHE}”
“Fatal mistake of those seeking ${DESIRED_THING} at the wrong ${WRONG_SOURCE_METAPHOR}”
“Why ${ACTION_OR_PRACTICE} stalls when touching unconfessed ${UNADDRESSED_ISSUES}”

**STYLE REFERENCES:**
${STYLE_REFERENCE_PERSON_1}
${STYLE_REFERENCE_PERSON_2}

**NEVER DO:**
Create topics with empty phrases like:
-${EMPTY_PHRASE_EXAMPLE_1}
-${EMPTY_PHRASE_EXAMPLE_2}
Use ready-made motivational phrases, unfounded ${GUIDANCE_TYPE} advice, or predictable lists.
Repeat formulas used in previous scripts.
Offer generic advice without explaining the ${KNOWLEDGE_BASE_MAIN}, neuroscientific, or emotional "why."
Visual or audio instructions
Images instructions (eg: **Start with an image of...**; **Show images of...**)
Music instructions (eg: **Now the music is like...**)

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**
${TARGET_AUDIENCE_DEMOGRAPHICS_AND_PSYCHOGRAPHICS}, in search of ${AUDIENCE_DESIRES}.
They don't want magical promises, but rather ${TARGET_AUDIENCE_WANTS}.

**OUTPUT FORMAT**

Your output MUST be a single, raw JSON object. DO NOT include any explanatory text, markdown formatting (like ```json), or any characters whatsoever before or after the JSON structure. Write in {$LANGUAGE_AND_REGION}
